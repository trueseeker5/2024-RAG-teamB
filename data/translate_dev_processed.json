Text \"SQXZ [your name] [your ID number]\" to 10086 to receive your code. The code will be valid for 60 minutes. \n\nStep 4: Visit a customer service center. Once you have the authorization code, you need to take your valid ID and the mobile SIM card you wish to port to a customer service center that is owned by the carrier you wish to port to, within the validity period of the code.
